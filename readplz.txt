This note is for Zach's eyes only lol:

I have been having a lot of trouble trying to translate my Mockup into code. Its been kind of a mess, and I'm feeling like 
somewhere along the line I missed something important. I've been researching this project apart and trying various methods of implication, and the more things I throw in the mix 
the more I think I've over complicated things at some points. 
I also the mockup I made might be maybe just outside of my skillset of comprehension right now and I've been really struggling to make ANYTHING 
look how I want it to, and how it does in FIGMA. 

I broke down the html fully, and then section by section have been revising and adding styling. This current editions style sheet i think was written down through the 
first three/four sections of html. I honestly have a lot of questions, but ive been more anxious these last few days and it makes it harder
to talk in front of everyone. Despite these being normal struggles and knowing I have nothing to feel bad about, it still is really hard for me to talk much
in front of people as of late. Im going to continue working on this until I get it, but was wondering if we could find some time to go over things together as well and
maybe help me fill in my knowledge gaps, or re calibrate my direction of action with this project.
